# Track-Faceoff  
Console-based C++ program for ranking your favorite songs using head-to-head face-offs

## 🎵 What it is  
Track-Faceoff is a simple yet fun C++ console application that allows you to input a list of songs and then repeatedly choose between two songs in a “face-off” format, ultimately ranking your full list from best to worst based on your binary choices.

## 🚀 Features  
- Input a list of songs (via file or console-prompt)  
- The program randomly selects pairs of songs for you to choose your preferred one  
- After enough comparisons, it outputs a full ranking from 1st place to last place  
- Lightweight, no external libraries required (just standard C++)  
- Console output for simplicity and portability

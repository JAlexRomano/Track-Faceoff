# Track-Faceoff  
Console-based C++ program for ranking your favorite songs using head-to-head face-offs

## 🎵 What it is  
Track-Faceoff is a C++ console application that allows you to input a list of songs and then repeatedly choose between two songs in a “face-off” format, ultimately ranking your full list from best to worst based on your binary choices.

## 🚀 Features  
- Use the 'make' command to compile if on a unix-based OS. Otherwise, run the Windows exe in bin
- Input your songs with a text file (via command line argument)
- The program randomly selects pairs of songs for you to choose your preferred one
- After enough comparisons, it outputs a full ranking from 1st place to last place
- Lightweight, no external libraries required (just standard C++)
- Console output for simplicity and portability
- Can write the output to a text file if that option is chosen
- This repo contains an example file (example.txt) to pass as an argument for demonstration
